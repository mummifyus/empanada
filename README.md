Instructions and software to create an [Informative Workspace with Raspberry
Pi](http://velocityconf.com/velocityny2013/public/schedule/detail/29924).

A [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a low-cost, low-power
Linux computer. It is designed to make computing inexpensive, hackable and fun.

This repo will contain a bill of materials, list of vendors, instructions, and
source code so that you can have your own informative workspace set up
cheaply, easily, and flexibly.

As of this writing, we are working to make the
software reliable and reusable in your environment before making it available.
We will have a baseline of the software delivered by the end of October 2013.

See [BOM.md](BOM.md) for what to order.

See [pi/INSTALL.md](pi/INSTALL.md) for instructions on installing the Raspberry Pi with
a configuration suitable for an information radiator.

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for details and progress.
